post /phones/{phone}/unsubscribe
Implementation Notes
Set a Phone's status on a Program to unsubscribed. If a Phone's status is unsubscribed then you are unable to send messages to it. The source and performed-at are both optional. The performed-at must be a valid ISO8601 timestamp in the past.

The following map demonstrates a Subscription object's transitions into the unsubscribed state.

  pending : unsubscribed
  subscribed : unsubscribed
  unsubscribed : unsubscribed
  confirmed : unsubscribed
  expired : unsubscribed
Response Class (Status 200)
Subscription successfully changed.
